# Challenge Overview

**Time taken:** 7 hours 23mins (4-6 hr guideline)
<br>

**Live site**: https://marketing-pod-tech-task.netlify.app/
<br>

**Thoughts:** On the face of it, I initally read the challenge and felt reasonably confident that I could acheive the basic requirements and even add a number of bonus features. 
That said, it ended up being a rather humbling experience, but still lots of fun! This was tough - which is actually a good thing - it helped me understand clearly I have a lot of work to do, as well as highlighting further areas I need to work on and improve. Ultimately, Iâ€™d didnâ€™t complete all of the task requirements.
<br>

**Challenges:** Tailwind install - not being able to install this was disapointing. handleDelete(), and onDelete() - this took me time to get right.
<br>

**Fails!:** Not being able to install tailwind via npm. I spent an additional 2 hours away researching this without success - I am still looking into this (ðŸ˜…) and hope to rebuild this again later on in the week with Tailwind.
<br>

**Features Added:**
Dark mode. Button hover, active states.

**Next steps**
I intend to rebuild this dashboard and complete all the requirements. Install Tailwind! Looking forward to it.
